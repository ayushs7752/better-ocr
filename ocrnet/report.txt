Approach:

Measuring accuracy:
Edit distance between text files - eg. Levenshtein distance
Using hocr - however problem was when words were split poorly
Box files - run into same error
Using CNN to splice image into individual words - very manually intensive to annotate and we donâ€™t have money
Using confidence intercal from tesseract itself + manually validate to make sure it is a good measure of accuracy

Retraining Tesseract:
	Use the pristine PDFs to generate the box file. The corresponding tif will be made with various augmentation techniques


Using CNN for word segmentation and then using tesseract word by word
